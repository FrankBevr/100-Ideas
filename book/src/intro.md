If you can afford 15 minutes of your time then this book is for you.  
If you can't, that's fine. Life is too short.

Before we start, brew a coffee, make yourself comfortable and add some Music.  
Personally, I can recommend a classical filter coffee on a fresh morning with some upbeat non-vocal music. _f.e._ [Ehrling](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPADUCehltvwFEKIuSpJ0ktRxGpQ)
