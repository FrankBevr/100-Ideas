# Outro

The Section `Outro` deals with the why.

Why in regards of, why I believe this tiny content is from use.\
If it wouldn't I wouldn't write it.

The `Think` Section is kind of a mental model that I made my own.

- First of all, its a blast of fun to brainstorm and throw everything around.
  Who doesn't like that. Escpecially with others.
- Second, mass counts. Having 30 Ideas on your selve instead of 3 served me
  really well. Can recommend.
- Third, its a good analytic tool. Instead of asking what, asking what's not,
  can catch some smelly fish in the water. In our case, I can name of whats
  wearo.xyz is not, 9 times. Could be 0.
- Lastly, god damnit, it takes 10 minutes. It doesn't have to be 100 Words,
  do 10. Make 3 sentences and run with it. I get nuts, when people overanalyze
  without not line of code is written or one rectangle is made or one ... .
  Otherwise to not give it a breath and explore options is not clever either.

The `Scratch` Section is my favorite. Take giant things and chop them down.

- First, its a nice framework to work in it. It covers a lot what is necessary
  to think through and in the end you can see, what is a sweet first step.
- Second, its a live safer for communication.

The `Paint` Section is just the beginning.

- First, the underlying message was. Keep it stupid simple.
- Second, building is hard. Making a step requires already a mountain of
  knowledge and skills. Getting something running is a masterpiece of its own.
  It counts.
- Third, leaving the proud and trying to be clever behind is not easy. Tiny
  little steps is not seen as glorious. But thats how we walk forward. One step
  after another.
- Lastly, Iterate. Don't hesitate to throw everything in the bin and do it
  again. Running without big thoughts has the benefits, if you crash a wall. You
  know there is a wall. Even the smartest chad, can't look around corners.

Overall, all three Section share one thing in common. **Speed** .\
This stuff takes an hour for me. It's an hour. I saw many people spending days in
brainstorming or structuring their Ideas or even weeks & months to make just one
tiny step.

> One of my favorite memories is my first Hackathon. It was an VR Hackathon. I

> always but I struggled and it was tsunami of information. Fun, but yikes, not
> cool. Then I participated on this thing called Hackathon. I pitched what I
> wanna do, asked for teammates and one cool dude joined me. We tried our best.
> In the first night a completely energized guy hopped by, walked around and saw
> what was going up. After an hour he decided he will join us. This guy name was

> more features. Had solution of Problems that i never thought of. This experience

**Are these Lessons new?**\
Nah, most likely not. Just another digestion of a human fellow and his
conclusion after consuming and experience things.

I hope you a fun in reading and maybe you catch some nice tricks for your
personal your toolbelt. Now 15 minutes are over. Your coffee is half empty and
maybe need small refill. So, go get it!
