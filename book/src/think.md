# üß† Think

The Section `Think` deals with How to generate an Idea.

## 100 Words

Lets generate 100 Words. I usually refer to it as collect 100 rich pictures. A rich picture is a vivid memory, experience or dream of yours.

A quick example. Do you remember how you drove your first time to the ice-scream shop with your family with your tiny bicycle. The sun, the laughter, the hurdle to going up the mountain, the dog who sniffed shamelessly on other dogs and everyone rolled their eyes. Correct that's a rich picture. We can call it Ice scream. Word 1.

Ice scream, dog, bicycle, high mountain, sunny

You can generate from one word with a rich picture association many other words, if you want. I prefer to keep it as one. Ice scream.

We want many. So we have to expand. The easiest route is to use our life. Alias Kindergarten, School, High School, Middle School, University, Job, University again, Freelancer, Job again, Cooperate, ... or boyfriend A, boyfriend B, girlfriend C, nofriend D, manyfriend E ... or home, there, here, there again ... or ... choose your poison of how you go through time. ü§∑

Enough tralala, lets do 100 Words.

OK. Maybe choosing only 5 Columns was no the best Idea. In the end I just added some classical buzzwords to flow it through and to call it a day. Everything is allowed.

You need rich pictures. That's it.

OK. Now we need creative juice. Orange Juice works great, if you wanna go nuts, try grapefruit.
Roughly it works the following. Think about picture, frame it in a theme and add a catchphrase. Tada, your billion Dollar Startup idea.

| Word            | Theme        | Catchphrase                                          |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Power Rangers   | Gadget       | Your Clock, your time                                |
| Nightwish       | Experience   | Eventbrite to the ground                             |
| Nightshift      | Learning     | Math your Friend                                     |
| Influencer      | Partnerships | Partnerships Mangment more personal then ever before |
| Wearables       | Game Assets  | Equip to the moon                                    |
| Particle Photon | Holograms    | Your House in your pocket, Live                      |
| Construction    | Big Machines | BEM on Chain                                         |
| QuantumIBM      | Radio        | Radio done new. Your Frequency, your assets          |
| CCC             | Community    | Tools create Community                               |

I will not elaborate each association. It makes sense to me and that's what counts. About every Catchphrase could be written articles. So just do the same, if you wanna. If you do it with a friend, that becomes a blob of fun.

## Rate & Select

Go with gut feeling. Take a number from 1 to 10 and call it a day. Then sort the Ideas

| Word            | Theme        | Catchphrase                                          | Rating |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| Particle Photon | Holograms    | Your House in your pocket, Live                      | 6      |
| Wearables       | Game Assets  | Equip to the moon                                    | 5      |
| Construction    | Big Machines | BEM on Chain                                         | 5      |

| CCC             | Community    | Tools create Community                               | 4      |
| Power Rangers   | Gadget       | Your Clock, your time                                | 2      |
| Nightwish       | Experience   | Eventbrite to the ground                             | 2      |
| Influencer      | Partnerships | Partnerships Mangment more personal then ever before | 2      |

So, here shines a lot of personal bias thruh as I just realised. Personalwise I would go with `Wearables`, i would change the catchphrase. But a cool Iron Man Watche is definitely something that I like and can run with it. Buisnesswise `Construction` is the best. BEM is ... BIM, I wanted to write BIM. BIM means Building Information Modeling. Its a way how to structure and store information on a construction side, in lay terms obviously. It already screams for decentralised technology. Nonetheless I don't want to run with it. I go with the quirky one. `Wearables` . Lets see if we can conjure something nicely up.

The Winner is `Wearo: Wearables think different`
