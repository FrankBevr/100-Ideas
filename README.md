## Description

```md
### Hola 🌤️

Its a book.

The book has 2 reasons of existence.

1. Tinker around wording & phrasing for an upcoming presentation.
2. I wanna write a book once in my life. Next up, plant a tee, I guess. 🐒

Its a 15 minutes read. Simple and Concise.\
Its covers three questions.

- How to generate Ideas.
- How to structure an Idea.
- How to make the first step.

This knowledge / skill served me really well.\
Copy whatever you find useful and make it your own.

### Cheers 👋

> [!TIP]  
> These are Ideas. To make something out of it needs work.
>
> - 20+ hour to have something
> - 100 hour to have something running
> - 200 hours to have kind of an MVP.
>
> That's my personal estimation. Usually everything needs some kind of UI, Frontend, Backend, SmartContract and in my cases I usually have a 3D chunk, which needs some love, as well.

## Future

1. Have a presentation. Get a glimbse of a broder reaction. Alias, It this cool
   or just useful to me 🤷
2. (undecided) Do a ink dev course. One simple Idea, one Project, one lesson
   after another.
